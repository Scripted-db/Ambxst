<h2><sub><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Objects/Package.png" alt="Package" width="32" height="32" /></sub> Installation</h2>

```bash
curl -L get.axeni.de/ambxst | sh
```

Ambxst is currently supported on **Arch**, **Fedora**, and **NixOS**. This means both based and derivative distributions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only pre-requisite is having Hyprland installed.

> [!NOTE]
> For NixOS users, the screen recording utility `gpu-screen-recorder` will only be able to use the `portal` backend until you add `programs.gpu-screen-recorder.enable = true;` to your `configuration.nix` or **home-manager**.

---

## Will this change my config?

Nope! Ambxst is designed to be non-intrusive. It won't modify any of your existing configurations.

It applies its own settings only when it runs, via IPC communication. This means you can safely switch back to your previous setup by simply exiting Ambxst.
